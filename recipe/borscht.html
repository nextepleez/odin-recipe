    <p>
      This is the best borscht I have ever eaten. Double the recipe, because it
      freezes well.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>6 cups water</li>
      <li>&frac34; tablespoon salt</li>
      <li>&frac12; cup finely chopped carrots</li>
      <li>&frac14; cup chopped green bell pepper, divided</li>
      <li>&frac12; stalk celery, chopped</li>
      <li>1 medium beet</li>
      <li>&frac12; cup canned peeled and diced tomatoes</li>
      <li>3 potatoes, quartered</li>
      <li>&frac13; cup butter</li>
      <li>&frac12; cup chopped onion</li>
      <li>1 &frac12; cups canned tomatoes</li>
      <li>3 cups finely shredded cabbage, divided</li>
      <li>&frac14; cup heavy cream</li>
      <li>&frac14; cup diced potatoes</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon dried dill weed</li>
      <li>&frac14; teaspoon ground black pepper to taste</li>
      <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Place water, salt, carrots, 1/2 of the bell pepper, celery, beet,
        tomatoes, and quartered potatoes in a large stock pot over high heat.
        Bring to a boil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Melt &frac13; cup butter in a separate skillet over medium heat. Saute
        onions in butter until tender, approximately 5 minutes. Stir in
        tomatoes, reduce heat to medium low, and simmer for 15 minutes. Remove
        &frac12; cup of sauce from skillet, and set aside. Stir half of the
        cabbage into the skillet with remaining sauce, and continue simmering 5
        minutes more, or until tender.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove beet from boiling liquid and discard. Remove potatoes with a
        slotted spoon or tongs, and place in a bowl with remaining 1 tablespoon
        of butter and the cream. Mash together until smooth.
      </li>
      <li>
        Return the &frac12; cup of reserved onion-tomato sauce to the stock pot.
        Stir in diced potatoes, and simmer until just tender but still firm,
        approximately 5 minutes. Increase heat to a low boil, and stir in
        remaining cabbage, tomato sauce, and mashed potatoes. Reduce heat and
        simmer a few minutes more. Stir in remaining bell pepper, season with
        black pepper, and serve.
      </li>
